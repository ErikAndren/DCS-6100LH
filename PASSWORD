The default password is DEC encoded.
On my device this was encoded and decoded to:
fVu/bhHghJ/H6 4cc339e6
However, this is stored on the /mnt/conf partition and may be unique for each device.
I'd love to get feedback on this.

Additionaly, by default, there is no network access so you need to hook up the serial in order to get a prompt.
