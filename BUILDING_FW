These notes are on how to build the firmware as supplied by dlink.
It can be downloaded here:
https://dlink-gpl.s3.amazonaws.com/GPL2000202/DCS-6100LH_v1.x_GPLCode.tar.gz

I have successfully built (but not deployed) this firmware on ubuntu 18.04.

The following packages needed to be install in addition to what is written in the supplied build instructions:
python
unzip


Need to update parition.ini in
/opt/DCS-6100LH

The supplied sizes will result in a build that doesn't fit.

TODO: Add parition.ini descriptions.

Note that the firmware update supplied from dlink does not update the whole system, only /mnt/mtd (firmware) and /mydlink (application)
