These notes are on how to build the firmware as supplied by dlink.
Build environment can be downloaded here:
https://dlink-gpl.s3.amazonaws.com/GPL2000202/DCS-6100LH_v1.x_GPLCode.tar.gz

I have successfully built (but not deployed) this firmware on ubuntu 18.04.

The following packages needed to be install in addition to what is written in the build instructions:
python
unzip

Need to update parition.ini in
/opt/DCS-6100LH

The supplied sizes will result in a build that doesn't fit.

TODO: Add parition.ini descriptions.

Note that the firmware update supplied from dlink does not update the whole system, only /mnt/mtd (firmware) and /mydlink (application)

Mapping of partitions is as follows:
16384k@0(global),320k@0k(boot),2304k@320k(kernel),3584k@2624k(rootfs),7744k@6208k(userdata),2048k@13952k(userdata2),384k@16000k(userdata3)


/dev/mtdblock3 / rootfs # Root file system, never updated via firmware update
/dev/mtdblock4 /mnt/mtd userdata # Local applications, updated via firmware
/dev/mtdblock5 /mydlink userdata2 # Mydlink application, updated via firmware
/dev/mtdblock6 /mnt/conf userdata3 # Private data, contains privata data such as password, SystemConfig.ini, private keys etc.
