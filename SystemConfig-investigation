The application supplied by D-link relies heavily on /mnt/conf/SystemConfig.ini.
It has a backup called /mnt/conf/SystemConfig.ini_backup which is also used by the main application.

This configuration (and application?) is used by multiple products and not all parameters are applicable for the DCS-6100.

What follows is an investigation what the different parameters do:
More work is needed on understanding what the different parameters do.
